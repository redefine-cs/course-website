## Course Description
**redefine** was started to promote diversity within computer science by encouraging more high schoolers to enter the space feeling confident and prepared, especially those students who may have never considered before. 

Despite the numerous innovations, high-growth startups, and venture-capital boom we have witnessed over the past few decades, the computer science community remains [very homogenous](https://www.wired.com/story/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress/). However, here at **redefine** we are hopeful that this cycle can be broken by exposing students to technical tools and theoretical concepts at a younger age and by embracing diversity in the field earlier on. 

We believe in the power of *personalized* education as a meaningful way to sustainably impact learning and personal development. The **redefine** program will always use live instruction and encourage community-building through group-work whenever possible. Moreover, instruction will be supplemented by guest-speakers and talks that will highlight how computer science permeates many industries. 

The program is expected to run over two months, from mid-June to mid-August. Keep up-to-date with all our announcements by filling out the form [here](https://redefine-cs.github.io/interest). We’re excited to hear from you! 

## Prerequisites
For math, students should be comfortable with algebra. There are no programming-related prerequisites for this program. 
## Requirements
**redefine** is completely virtual and free for students. The only requirements for participation in this program is access to a computer and an internet connection. 
For lectures, talks, and work sessions, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). 

For homework and in-class exercises, we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com)  and Google Docs. To use Colaboratory and Google Docs, you will need a Google (Gmail) account or [create one](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) if you do not already have an account. If you’d like to get acclimated with Colaboratory, you can find instructions on getting started [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), but feel free to wait as we’ll be introducing it during our first lecture.

If you need help with any of the above, feel free to reach out to us at `redefinecs.staff@gmail.com`. 

## Course Structure

The program will run for eight weeks starting in mid-June (exact start date TBD). Each week, we will have 3-5 hours of instruction per week, with 2 hours of interdisciplinary talks per week, and roughly 3-4 hours of homework per week.
