## Requirements
**redefine** is completely virtual and free for students. This program is intended for students who have no prior coding experience.

For lectures, talks, and work sessions, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). If you do not have an account with Zoom already, you will need to [create one](https://zoom.us/signup).

For homework and in-class exercises, we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) and Google Docs. To use Colaboratory and Google Docs, you will need a Google (Gmail) account or [create one](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) if you do not already have an account. If you’d like to get acclimated with Colaboratory, you can find instructions on getting started [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), but feel free to wait as we’ll be introducing it during our first lecture.

If you need help with any of the above, please reach out to us at `redefinecs.staff@gmail.com`. We will do our best to accommodate any technology or connectivity issues.

## Program Structure

The program will run from June 26th until August 14th. Each week, we will have 4 hours of lecture-based instruction, 2 hours of interactive coding sessions, and 1 hour of interdisciplinary talks. Additionally, students should expect to spend roughly 5 hours each week working on homework, with optional collaborative work sessions hosted throughout the week. Lectures will be held on Wednesday evening (5-7pm Pacific Time) and Saturday morning (10am-noon Pacific Time). 

Each student will also be assigned a mentor, with whom they will meet on a weekly basis to review progress and discuss learning goals. Mentorship sessions will be 1 hour each week at self-scheduled times based on mentor/student availability.

## Testimonials

This is our second iteration of **redefine**, following a successful inaugural program in the summer of 2020. We had a phenomenal batch of students in the first session — we are excited to share some student thoughts from the exit survey we conducted last year.

- “[My favorite part was] learning to code, it's like a whole new world! It really opened my eyes to new possibilities and maybe a new major interest. Also, meeting new people.”

- “[I enjoyed] the love and support shared to us by the instructors and mentors. The lectures were given in an organised way. The guest speeches were very helpful and interesting. We got to meet new friendly community.”

- "I enjoyed learning from you... [it] really inspired me to work hard and learn a lot more of coding... I wouldn't have asked for a better program to be in."

- "My mentor was amazing, I enjoyed the mentor meetings because he would help me on every little detail of code until I understood it. When the meeting should have been 30 minutes, it would take almost 2 hours. It was very useful and helpful when doing my homework."

"[My favorite lecture topic was] cryptography. It was challenging to learn at first, but once I got the hang of it (well sort of) it is really fascinating to work with."

- "I still want to pursue architecture, but I'm also interested in how I can use computer science as well to help with designing better elevations and floor plans."

We are thankful for our wonderful students and are so glad they have enjoyed learning computer science through our program. In fact, 71% of our alumni students have indicated that they intend to major in computer science in college. We look forward to following all of their bright futures — and to welcoming new students this summer!  


## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Professor Rajiv Gandhi from the University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University-Camden for his continued help and support with this program. We would also like to acknowledge USVICoder and AddisCoder, led by Professor Jelani Nelson from the University of California, Berkeley, from which much of our material is adapted.
