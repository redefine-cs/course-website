## Program Details  

**redefine** is a free, virtual summer program targeted at rising freshmen and sophomores. We seek to introduce computer science (programming and theory) to students who otherwise might not have considered it as a career option. Weâ€™re motivated by a vision of a more equitable and ethical tech industry through increased diversity and representation.
