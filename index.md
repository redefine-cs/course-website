## redefine 

**redefine** is a virtual summer program targeted at rising freshmen and sophomores to computer science. We seek to introduce CS (programming and theory) to students who otherwise might not have considered it as a career option. Weâ€™re motivated by a vision of a more equitable and ethical tech industry through increased diversity and representation.

For more information about [the program](about), [the curriculum](curriculum), and the [course staff](staff) please check out the links on the left.
