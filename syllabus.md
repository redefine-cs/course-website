## Requirements
**redefine** is completely virtual and free for students. This program is intended for students who have no prior coding experience.

For lectures, talks, and work sessions, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). If you do not have an account with Zoom already, you will need to [create one](https://zoom.us/signup).

For homework and in-class exercises, we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) and Google Docs. To use Colaboratory and Google Docs, you will need a Google (Gmail) account or [create one](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) if you do not already have an account. If you’d like to get acclimated with Colaboratory, you can find instructions on getting started [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), but feel free to wait as we’ll be introducing it during our first lecture.

If you need help with any of the above, please reach out to us at `redefinecs.staff@gmail.com`. We will do our best to accommodate any technology or connectivity issues.

## Program Structure

The program will run from June 26th until August 14th. Each week, we will have 4 hours of lecture-based instruction, 2 hours of interactive coding sessions, and 1 hour of interdisciplinary talks. Additionally, students should expect to spend roughly 5 hours each week working on homework, with optional collaborative work sessions hosted throughout the week. Lectures will be held on Wednesday evening (5-7pm Pacific Time) and Saturday morning (10am-noon Pacific Time). 

Each student will also be assigned a mentor, with whom they will meet on a weekly basis to review progress and discuss learning goals. Mentorship sessions will be 1-hr each week at self-scheduled times based on mentor/student availability.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Professor Rajiv Gandhi from the University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University-Camden for his continued help and support with this program. We would also like to acknowledge USVICoder and AddisCoder, led by Professor Jelani Nelson from the University of California, Berkeley, from which much of our material is adapted.
