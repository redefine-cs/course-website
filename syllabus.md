## Prerequisites
For math, students should be comfortable with algebra. There are no programming-related prerequisites for this program.
## Requirements
**redefine** is completely virtual and free for students. The only requirements for participation in this program is access to a computer and an internet connection.
For lectures, talks, and work sessions, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

For homework and in-class exercises, we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com)  and Google Docs. To use Colaboratory and Google Docs, you will need a Google (Gmail) account or [create one](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) if you do not already have an account. If you’d like to get acclimated with Colaboratory, you can find instructions on getting started [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), but feel free to wait as we’ll be introducing it during our first lecture.

If you need help with any of the above, feel free to reach out to us at `redefinecs.staff@gmail.com`.

## Program Structure

The program will run for eight weeks starting in mid-June (exact start date TBD). Each week, we will have 3-5 hours of instruction per week, with 2 hours of interdisciplinary talks per week, and roughly 3-4 hours of homework per week.
