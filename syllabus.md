## Requirements
**redefine** is completely virtual and free for students.

For lectures, talks, and work sessions, we will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

For homework and in-class exercises, we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com)  and Google Docs. To use Colaboratory and Google Docs, you will need a Google (Gmail) account or [create one](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) if you do not already have an account. If you’d like to get acclimated with Colaboratory, you can find instructions on getting started [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), but feel free to wait as we’ll be introducing it during our first lecture.

If you need help with any of the above, feel free to reach out to us at `redefinecs.staff@gmail.com`. We will do our best to accommodate any technology constraints.

## Program Structure

The program will run from June 24th until August 8th. Each week, we will have around 4 hours of instruction, 2 hours of interdisciplinary talks, and 4 hours of homework, with additional collaborative work sessions and office hours. For US-based students, lectures will be held on Wednesday evening and Saturday morning (Pacific Time). For students based in Rwanda, lectures will be held on Saturday evening (Central Africa Time). Mentorship sessions will be 30-minutes each week and self-scheduled per mentor/student availability.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Professor Rajiv Gandhi from the University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University-Camden for his continued help and support with this program.
