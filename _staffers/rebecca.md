I’m a 3rd-year PhD student  at the University of Pennsylvania studying Natural Language Processing (a super cool niche field in computer science)!!!  I’m here because I’m hoping by the end of this program I can convince you to pursue computer science for the rest of your life and show you why it’s going to be the best decision you ever made.  When I first started computer science I was scared and intimidated and felt so small, but I leave you a quote to remind you that life’s about adventure and all the adversity and breakthroughs that come with it (-:  “It’s the fight alone that pleases, not the victory.” -Blaise Pascal. Looking forward to meeting you!!!
