**(Mentor)** Hi I’m Fran! Some things about me are that I’m currently focusing on tapping into my artistic side (guitar, piano, painting and writing). I was hesitant to declare CS for 1.5 years because I thought I was not good enough to be a computer programmer. But I was wrong. It was about believing in yourself, because **once you believe you CAN you are more than 70% of the way there**! When I built my first full stack web app, I had the literal feeling of “I was born to be a computer scientist” (that was a wild day!). Now though, I connect more to the idea of teaching computer science (instead of computer science itself) because I want to help students gain confidence in their ability, like someone helped me!
