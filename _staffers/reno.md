**(Mentor)** Iâ€™m a 5th-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. Specifically I work in Natural Language Processing, which basically means that I help computers better understand human languages. Prior to Penn, I went to Vassar College, and graduated with Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics (I just couldnâ€™t decide ðŸ˜…). Outside of education, I played varsity volleyball at Vassar and club volleyball at Penn, and still love playing as much as possible. Iâ€™m super excited to meet all of you, and I hope we can help you love coding too!
