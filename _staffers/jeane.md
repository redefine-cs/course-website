Hello! I graduated a few months ago from St. Johns University. I've done a few internships at Amazon and Facebook, and I now currently work as a web engineer for Robinhood (the stock market trading app). I'm a late bloomer when it comes to tech... I only just started getting into the field two years ago after briefly exploring opportunities in physics and government. But all it took was one hackathon for me to see the power coders have in being able to build anything: games, websites, and apps that make people happy!
