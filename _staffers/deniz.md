**(Mentor)** Hey Iâ€™m Deniz! I just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May with a  degree in Computer Science. I am from Turkey, but I am currently trapped in Philadelphia because of corona ðŸ˜…Currently, since I have a little bit more time in my hands, I am learning spanish, reading more, painting and doing yoga. I love teaching and helping people, so I am looking forward to helping all of you! I love it when I see people get excited & confident after they have conquered a new subject, and after the program I hope to see that excitement & confidence in all of you! ðŸ˜Š I hope you guys end up enjoying computer science as much as we do! Looking forward to meeting you guys!
