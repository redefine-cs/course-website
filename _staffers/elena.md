(Mentor) Hi, I’m Elena! I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 and now live in San Francisco, CA, where I work as a software engineer at Lyft Level 5, Lyft’s Autonomous Vehicles division. I love to jog, watch documentaries, play ball with my bulldog Hippo, and solve difficult problems. For those new to tech, welcome! My biggest advice: be yourself! There is a place for you here.
